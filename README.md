This is a desktop talkback assistant that I made in the first year of my college as a mini project that can do menial tasks for you 
on voice commands like open youtube, open gmail, open spotify, speak out the time, tell you the weather etc.
This is one of the first projects that I ever made and it is pretty basic but I had fun making it and learning about the variious 
python libraries like SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, pyaudio etc.
